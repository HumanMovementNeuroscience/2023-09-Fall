## Course Description
Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g., [sports], [dance], or [everyday-activities]) by investigating the [neural-control] of [full-body] [human-movement]. The course will cover [philosophical], [technological], and [scientific] aspects related to the study of [natural-behavior] while emphasizing hands-on, project-based learning. Students will use [free-open-source-software], and [artificial-intelligence],[machine-learning] and [computer-vision] driven tools and methods to record human movement in unconstrained environments.

The course promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and introduces modern techniques for decentralized [project-management], [AI-assisted-research-techniques], and [Python]-based programming (No prior programming experience is required). Students will receive training in the use of AI technology for project management and research conduct, including [literature-review], [data-analysis], [data-visualization], and [presentation-of-results]. Through experiential learning, students will develop valuable skills in planning and executing technology-driven research projects while examining the impact of structural inequities on scientific inquiry.
