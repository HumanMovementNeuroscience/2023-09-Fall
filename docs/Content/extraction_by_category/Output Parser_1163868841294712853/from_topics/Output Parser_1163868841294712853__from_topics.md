# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural control of human movement in real-world scenarios. It covers various topics related to motor control, neuroscience, and sensorimotor integration.

## [[Motor Control]]
- Motor control refers to the process by which the central nervous system coordinates and regulates the movements of the body. It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements.

## [[Neuroscience]]
- Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. It explores the structure and function of neurons, neural circuits, and the mechanisms underlying behavior and cognition.

## [[Sensorimotor Integration]]
- Sensorimotor integration is the process by which sensory information is used to guide motor actions. It involves the integration of sensory inputs, such as vision, proprioception, and touch, with motor outputs to produce coordinated movements.

## [[Motion Capture]]
- Motion capture is a technique used to record and analyze human movement. It involves the use of sensors or cameras to track the position and orientation of markers placed on the body, allowing for the capture of detailed movement data.

## [[Perceptuomotor]]
- Perceptuomotor refers to the integration of perceptual and motor processes. It involves the coordination of sensory perception with motor actions, allowing for adaptive and skilled movements.

## [[Hippocampus]]
- The hippocampus is a region of the brain involved in memory formation and spatial navigation. It plays a role in learning and memory processes related to motor control.

## [[Basal Ganglia]]
- The basal ganglia are a group of structures in the brain involved in motor control and movement coordination. They play a role in the selection and initiation of voluntary movements.

## [[Motor Planning]]
- Motor planning refers to the process of organizing and coordinating the sequence of movements required to achieve a specific goal. It involves the selection of appropriate motor programs and the anticipation of sensory feedback.

## [[Action Selection]]
- Action selection refers to the process by which the brain chooses among different possible actions. It involves the evaluation of sensory information, the generation of motor plans, and the selection of the most appropriate action based on internal and external factors.

## [[Motor Function]]
- Motor function refers to the ability to perform voluntary movements and control body posture. It involves the coordination of muscles, joints, and sensory feedback to produce purposeful movements.

## [[Parkinson's Disease]]
- Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra.

## [[Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)]]
- Deep brain stimulation is a surgical procedure used to treat Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. It involves the implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions and the delivery of electrical signals to modulate neural activity and alleviate motor symptoms.

## [[Rehabilitation Therapies]]
- Rehabilitation therapies are interventions aimed at improving the functional abilities and quality of life of individuals with movement disorders. They may include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, among others.

## [[Neurodegenerative Disorders]]
- Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of conditions characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain and/or spinal cord. They can lead to motor deficits and other neurological symptoms.

## [[Motor Symptoms]]
- Motor symptoms refer to the physical manifestations of a movement disorder or neurological condition. They may include tremors, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability.

## [[Therapeutic Strategies]]
- Therapeutic strategies are approaches used to manage and treat movement disorders. They may include medication, surgery, physical therapy, and other interventions aimed at improving motor function and quality of life.

## [[Neurorehabilitation]]
- Neurorehabilitation is a branch of rehabilitation medicine that focuses on the recovery and rehabilitation of individuals with neurological conditions. It involves the use of various techniques and interventions to promote functional recovery and improve quality of life.

## [[Robotic Technologies for Rehabilitating Motor Impairments]]
- Robotic technologies are increasingly being used in the rehabilitation of individuals with motor impairments. These technologies can provide high-intensity interventions, adaptive algorithms, and patient-robot-therapist interactions to promote sensorimotor learning and functional movement.

## [[Functional Movement Disorders]]
- Functional movement disorders are a group of conditions characterized by abnormal movements or postures that are not due to a neurological disease or structural abnormality. They are thought to be related to psychological or emotional factors.

## [[Balance]]
- Balance refers to the ability to maintain the body's center of mass within the base of support. It is essential for activities such as walking, standing, and performing functional tasks.

## [[Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)]]
- Tra
