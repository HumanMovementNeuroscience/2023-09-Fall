# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural mechanisms that control human movement in real-world scenarios.
- It explores how the brain and nervous system coordinate and regulate movement in response to various environmental and task demands.

## [[Motor Control]]
- Motor control refers to the process by which the nervous system coordinates and regulates the movement of muscles.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movement.

## [[Neuromuscular System]]
- The neuromuscular system consists of the muscles and the nerves that control them.
- It plays a crucial role in the execution and control of human movement.

## [[Sensorimotor Integration]]
- Sensorimotor integration refers to the process by which sensory information is used to plan and execute movement.
- It involves the integration of sensory inputs from various modalities, such as vision, proprioception, and touch.

## [[Motor Learning]]
- Motor learning is the process by which the nervous system acquires and refines motor skills through practice and experience.
- It involves the adaptation and optimization of movement patterns based on feedback and error detection.

## [[Motor Development]]
- Motor development refers to the changes in motor skills and abilities that occur throughout the lifespan.
- It involves the acquisition and refinement of motor skills from infancy to adulthood.

## [[Motor Disorders]]
- Motor disorders are conditions that affect the normal functioning of the motor system.
- They can result in impairments in movement control, coordination, and execution.

## [[Neuroplasticity]]
- Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and adapt its structure and function in response to experience and learning.
- It plays a crucial role in motor control and motor learning.

## [[Motor Rehabilitation]]
- Motor rehabilitation involves the use of therapeutic interventions to improve motor function in individuals with motor disorders or injuries.
- It aims to restore or enhance motor skills and abilities through targeted exercises and interventions.

## [[Biomechanics]]
- Biomechanics is the study of the mechanical principles that govern human movement.
- It involves the analysis of forces, motion, and the interaction between the body and the environment during movement.

## [[Motor Control Models]]
- Motor control models are theoretical frameworks that describe and explain the processes involved in motor control.
- They provide a conceptual understanding of how the nervous system coordinates and regulates movement.

## [[Motor Control Assessment]]
- Motor control assessment involves the evaluation of motor skills and abilities in individuals.
- It helps to identify motor control impairments, monitor progress, and guide treatment planning.

## [[Motor Control Interventions]]
- Motor control interventions are therapeutic strategies and techniques used to improve motor control and function.
- They can include exercises, manual therapy, assistive devices, and technology-based interventions.

## [[Neural Control of Balance]]
- The neural control of balance refers to the mechanisms by which the nervous system maintains postural stability and equilibrium.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements to maintain balance.

## [[Neural Control of Gait]]
- The neural control of gait refers to the mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates and coordinates walking movements.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements during walking.

## [[Neural Control of Upper Extremity Movement]]
- The neural control of upper extremity movement refers to the mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates and coordinates movements of the arms and hands.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements during activities such as reaching and grasping.

## [[Neural Control of Lower Extremity Movement]]
- The neural control of lower extremity movement refers to the mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates and coordinates movements of the legs and feet.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements during activities such as walking and running.

## [[Neural Control of Fine Motor Skills]]
- The neural control of fine motor skills refers to the mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates and coordinates precise movements of the fingers and hands.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements during activities such as writing and playing musical instruments.
