INPUT_TEXT:


The conversation discusses the accuracy and potential applications of eye-tracking technology. The AI explains that eye-tracking can be highly accurate, but it can vary depending on the device, user behavior, and environmental conditions. The AI also mentions rumors about Apple's VR headset having impressive eye-tracking capabilities. The conversation then explores other uses of eye-trackers, such as academic research, marketing, medical applications, and assistive technologies. The AI explains that while it is technically possible to use a regular camera for eye-tracking, specialized eye-tracking systems are preferred for better accuracy and usability. The conversation also touches on the cost of eye-tracking technology, with affordable models being a few hundred dollars and high-end research-grade systems costing thousands. The AI mentions that machine learning can be used in eye-tracking technology to improve accuracy and predict gaze direction. The AI suggests using Python and open-source libraries like OpenCV for image processing tasks related to eye-tracking.
