# [[Nervous System and Human Movement]]
- The conversation starts with the human suggesting to give a brain dump of all the topics they just covered so that people can refer back to it later.
- The human provides an overview of the topics discussed in an outline format, covering the nervous system and human movement, active perception, musculoskeletal biomechanics, somatosensory information, full body biomechanics, and behavioral dynamics.

## [[Cortex]]
- The conversation mentions the cortex as part of the nervous system and human movement.

## [[Visual aspects]]
- The conversation mentions visual aspects related to the nervous system and human movement.
- Topics related to visual aspects include retina, foveated vision, oculomotor control, pathways, optic chiasm, thalamus, and cortical areas.

## [[Musculoskeletal Biomechanics]]
- The conversation mentions musculoskeletal biomechanics as part of the topics discussed.
- Topics related to musculoskeletal biomechanics include muscular level, muscle spindles, and Golgi bodies.

## [[Somatosensory Information]]
- The conversation mentions somatosensory information as part of the topics discussed.

## [[Full Body Biomechanics]]
- The conversation mentions full body biomechanics as part of the topics discussed.
- Topics related to full body biomechanics include center of mass.

## [[Behavioral Dynamics]]
- The conversation mentions behavioral dynamics as part of the topics discussed.
- Topics related to behavioral dynamics include information coupling with the environment.

# [[Peripheral Nervous System]]
- The conversation mentions the peripheral nervous system.

# [[Active Perception]]
- The conversation mentions active perception as part of the topics discussed.
- Topics related to active perception include the central role of oculomotor control in human vision and perceptual motor control.

# [[Subcortical Structures]]
- The conversation mentions subcortical structures as part of the nervous system and human movement.
- Specific subcortical structures mentioned include the cerebellum, brainstem, spinal level control, central pattern generators, and reflex gating.

# [[Photoreceptors in the Eye]]
- The conversation mentions photoreceptors in the eye.
- Topics related to photoreceptors include opsins and photon absorption.

# [[Apology]]
- The human apologizes for posting in the wrong channel.

# [[Greeting]]
- The human wishes the AI a good day.
- The AI responds and also wishes the human a great day.

# [[Help]]
- The AI offers assistance if the human has any further questions or needs help.

INPUT_TEXT:

```

The conversation starts with the human suggesting to give a brain dump of all the topics they just covered so that people can refer back to it later. The AI agrees and expresses readiness to help discuss and clarify any concepts. The human then tries to transcribe an audio file but the AI is unable to access it. The human provides another audio file but the AI still cannot access it. The human then provides an overview of the topics discussed in an outline format, covering the nervous system and human movement, active perception, musculoskeletal biomechanics, somatosensory information, full body biomechanics, and behavioral dynamics. The AI asks for a description or key points from an image, but the human apologizes and says they cannot provide that.
