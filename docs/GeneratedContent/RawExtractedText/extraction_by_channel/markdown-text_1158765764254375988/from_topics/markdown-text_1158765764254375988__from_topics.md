# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural mechanisms that control human movement in real-world scenarios.
- It explores how the brain and nervous system coordinate and regulate movement in response to various environmental and task demands.

## [[Motor Control]]
- Motor control refers to the process by which the nervous system coordinates and regulates the movements of muscles and limbs.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movement.

## [[Neuromuscular System]]
- The neuromuscular system consists of the muscles and the nerves that control them.
- It plays a crucial role in the execution and control of human movement.

## [[Sensorimotor Integration]]
- Sensorimotor integration refers to the process by which sensory information is used to plan and execute movements.
- It involves the integration of sensory inputs from various modalities, such as vision, proprioception, and touch.

## [[Motor Learning]]
- Motor learning is the process by which individuals acquire and improve motor skills through practice and experience.
- It involves the adaptation and optimization of motor control strategies based on feedback and error detection.

## [[Motor Adaptation]]
- Motor adaptation refers to the ability of the motor system to adjust and modify movements in response to changes in the environment or task demands.
- It allows individuals to adapt their movements to new conditions and learn new motor skills.

## [[Neural Plasticity]]
- Neural plasticity refers to the ability of the nervous system to change and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience and learning.
- It plays a crucial role in motor learning, motor adaptation, and recovery from injury.

## [[Motor Disorders]]
- Motor disorders are conditions that affect the normal functioning of the motor system.
- They can result from various factors, including neurological damage, genetic abnormalities, and developmental disorders.

## [[Clinical Applications]]
- The knowledge and understanding of the neural control of human movement have important clinical applications.
- It can help in the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of individuals with motor disorders and injuries.

## [[Emerging Research Areas]]
- There are several emerging research areas in the field of neural control of human movement.
- These include the use of brain-computer interfaces, virtual reality, and robotics to study and enhance human movement capabilities.
