# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural control of human movement in real-world scenarios. It covers various topics related to motor control, neuroscience, and sensorimotor integration.

## [[Motor Control]]
- Motor control refers to the process by which the central nervous system coordinates and regulates the movements of the body. It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements.

## [[Neuroscience]]
- Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. It explores the structure, function, and mechanisms of the nervous system, with a focus on understanding how it controls human movement.

## [[Sensorimotor Integration]]
- Sensorimotor integration is the process by which sensory information is used to plan and execute movements. It involves the integration of sensory inputs, such as vision, proprioception, and touch, with motor outputs to produce coordinated movements.

## [[Motion Capture]]
- Motion capture is a technique used to record and analyze human movement. It involves the use of sensors or cameras to track the position and orientation of the body in order to capture and analyze movement data.

## [[Perceptuomotor]]
- Perceptuomotor refers to the integration of perception and action in the control of movement. It involves the processing of sensory information to guide motor actions and the use of motor actions to gather sensory information.

## [[Hippocampus]]
- The hippocampus is a region of the brain involved in memory formation and spatial navigation. It plays a role in the control of movement and the integration of sensory and motor information.

## [[Basal Ganglia]]
- The basal ganglia are a group of structures in the brain involved in motor control and movement coordination. They play a role in the selection and initiation of voluntary movements.

## [[Motor Planning]]
- Motor planning refers to the process of organizing and coordinating the sequence of movements required to perform a specific action. It involves the selection of appropriate motor programs and the generation of motor commands.

## [[Action Selection]]
- Action selection refers to the process by which the brain chooses among different possible actions. It involves the evaluation of sensory information, the generation of action plans, and the selection of the most appropriate action based on internal and external factors.

## [[Motor Function]]
- Motor function refers to the ability to control and coordinate movements. It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movements to achieve specific goals.

## [[Parkinson's Disease]]
- Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. It leads to motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The disease affects the neural control of movement and has a significant impact on the quality of life.

## [[Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)]]
- Deep brain stimulation is a surgical procedure used to treat Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. It involves the implantation of a brain pacemaker that delivers electrical signals to specific areas of the brain to alleviate motor symptoms.

## [[Rehabilitation Therapies]]
- Rehabilitation therapies are interventions aimed at improving the functional abilities and quality of life of individuals with movement disorders. They include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and other multidisciplinary approaches.

## [[Neurodegenerative Disorders]]
- Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of diseases characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain and spinal cord. They often lead to motor deficits and movement disorders.

## [[Anemia]]
- Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. It can lead to fatigue, depressed mood, and cognitive impairments, which can affect exercise capacity and functional movement.

## [[Vestibular Rehabilitation]]
- Vestibular rehabilitation is a specialized form of physical therapy aimed at improving balance and reducing dizziness and other vestibular complaints. It involves customized therapy based on objective outcome measures and the patient's entry level of function and expectation level of recovery.

## [[Robotic Technologies for Rehabilitating Motor Impairments]]
- Robotic technologies are being increasingly used in the rehabilitation of motor impairments caused by neurological injuries. They offer high-intensity interventions, adaptive algorithms, and patient-robot-therapist relationships to promote sensorimotor learning and functional movement.

## [[Upper Motor Neurons]]
- Upper motor neurons are nerve cells that transmit signals from the brain to the spinal cord and control voluntary movements. They play a crucial role in fine motor skills and the control of movement.

## [[Instrumented Assessment]]
- Instrumented assessment refers to the use of sensors and technology to objectively measure motor function. It includes biomechanical analysis, motion capture systems, and other tools to assess movement patterns and identify musculoskeletal disorders.

## [[Motor Symptoms]]
- Motor symptoms are physical manifestations
