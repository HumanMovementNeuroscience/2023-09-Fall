# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural mechanisms that control human movement in real-world scenarios.
- It explores how the brain and nervous system coordinate and regulate movement in response to various environmental and task demands.

## [[Motor Control]]
- Motor control refers to the process by which the nervous system coordinates and regulates the movement of muscles.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movement.

## [[Neuromuscular System]]
- The neuromuscular system consists of the muscles and the nerves that control them.
- It plays a crucial role in the execution and control of human movement.

## [[Sensorimotor Integration]]
- Sensorimotor integration refers to the process by which sensory information is used to plan and execute movement.
- It involves the integration of sensory inputs from various modalities, such as vision, proprioception, and touch.

## [[Motor Learning]]
- Motor learning is the process by which the nervous system acquires and refines motor skills through practice and experience.
- It involves the adaptation and optimization of movement patterns based on feedback and error detection.

## [[Motor Development]]
- Motor development refers to the changes in motor skills and abilities that occur throughout the lifespan.
- It involves the interaction between genetic factors, environmental influences, and the maturation of the nervous system.

## [[Motor Disorders]]
- Motor disorders are conditions that affect the normal functioning of the motor system.
- They can result in impairments in movement control, coordination, and execution.

## [[Neuroplasticity]]
- Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and adapt its structure and function in response to experience and learning.
- It plays a crucial role in motor control and motor learning.

## [[Movement Analysis]]
- Movement analysis involves the measurement and evaluation of human movement.
- It includes the assessment of kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity during various motor tasks.

## [[Biomechanics]]
- Biomechanics is the study of the mechanical principles that govern human movement.
- It involves the analysis of forces, torques, and motion in the human body.

## [[Neurophysiology]]
- Neurophysiology is the study of the function of the nervous system.
- It involves the measurement and analysis of neural activity and the study of neural circuits and pathways.

## [[Neuroimaging]]
- Neuroimaging techniques allow for the visualization and study of the structure and function of the brain.
- They provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human movement.

## [[Neurological Rehabilitation]]
- Neurological rehabilitation is the process of restoring function and improving quality of life in individuals with neurological disorders or injuries.
- It involves the use of various therapeutic interventions to promote motor recovery and adaptation.

## [[Human-Robot Interaction]]
- Human-robot interaction focuses on the design and development of robotic systems that can interact and collaborate with humans.
- It involves the study of how humans and robots can work together to perform complex motor tasks.

## [[Ethical Considerations]]
- Ethical considerations in the field of neural control of human movement involve the responsible use of technology and the protection of human rights and dignity.
- They include issues related to privacy, informed consent, and the potential impact of technology on society.
