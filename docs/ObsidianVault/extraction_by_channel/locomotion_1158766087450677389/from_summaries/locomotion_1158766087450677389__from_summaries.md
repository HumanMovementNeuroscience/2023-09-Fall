INPUT_TEXT:

```

The conversation discusses the choice between an EIT kit system and MATLAB with Neural Networks toolbox for a project involving the analysis of a patient's physical condition and tracking their progress over time. The EIT kit system allows for real-time imaging of internal body structures, while MATLAB with Neural Networks toolbox offers data analysis and pattern recognition. The conversation also explores the addition of imaging modalities, data storage, and user interface to the EIT system. The idea of creating an at-home version of the tool is discussed, which would involve using MMG/IMU sensors and a force plate. The conversation highlights the importance of healthcare accessibility, preventative care, and addressing physician shortages. The concept of end-users is explained, and it is suggested to involve them in the design process to ensure the tool meets their needs and abilities. The number of EIT sensors required for accurate body imaging is discussed, with the suggested placement being 1-2 per limb and one on the core. The conversation concludes by addressing the pros and cons of using an EIT kit system versus MATLAB with Neural Networks toolbox for the project.
