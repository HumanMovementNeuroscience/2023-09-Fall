# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural mechanisms that control human movement in real-world scenarios.
- It explores how the brain and nervous system coordinate and regulate movement in response to various environmental and task demands.

## [[Motor Control]]
- Motor control refers to the process by which the nervous system coordinates and regulates the movement of muscles.
- It involves the integration of sensory information, motor planning, and execution of movement.

## [[Neuromuscular System]]
- The neuromuscular system consists of the muscles and the nerves that control them.
- It plays a crucial role in the execution and control of human movement.

## [[Sensorimotor Integration]]
- Sensorimotor integration refers to the process by which sensory information is used to plan and execute movement.
- It involves the integration of sensory inputs from various modalities, such as vision, proprioception, and touch.

## [[Motor Learning]]
- Motor learning is the process by which individuals acquire and improve motor skills through practice and experience.
- It involves the adaptation and optimization of motor control strategies.

## [[Motor Disorders]]
- Motor disorders are conditions that affect the normal functioning of the motor system.
- They can result in impairments in movement coordination, strength, and control.

## [[Biomechanics]]
- Biomechanics is the study of the mechanical principles that govern human movement.
- It involves the analysis of forces, motion, and the interaction between the body and the environment.

## [[Neuroplasticity]]
- Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and adapt its structure and function in response to experience.
- It plays a crucial role in motor learning and recovery from motor disorders.

## [[Motor Rehabilitation]]
- Motor rehabilitation is the process of restoring or improving motor function in individuals with motor disorders.
- It involves the use of various therapeutic interventions and techniques to promote recovery and functional independence.

## [[Motor Control in Sports]]
- Motor control principles and techniques are applied in sports to optimize performance and prevent injuries.
- It involves the analysis and training of movement patterns, coordination, and motor skills specific to sports activities.
