# [[Neural Control of Real World Human Movement]]
- This course focuses on the neural control of real-world human movement and its various aspects.

## [[Role of the Basal Ganglia in Parkinson's Disease]]
- The basal ganglia and its specific disruptions play a crucial role in Parkinson's disease.
- The effects of Parkinson's disease on gait and movement are explored.
- Animal models, such as mice and non-human primates, are used to study Parkinson's disease.
- Freezing of gait is a specific symptom associated with Parkinson's disease.
- Research on the basal ganglia and Parkinson's disease is discussed.

## [[Neuromuscular Diseases]]
- Neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis, affect the brain and body.
- The immune system, nerve fibers, myelin, and scar tissue are involved in these diseases.
- Different types of neurons, including motor neurons, sensory neurons, pyramidal neurons, and Purkinje cells, are affected.
- The immune response, involving T cells, B cells, macrophages, inflammation, and the blood-brain barrier, plays a role in these diseases.

## [[Brain and Eye Movements]]
- The brain and its connections control eye movements and locomotion.
- The cerebellum, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, and other subcortical nuclei are involved in motor control and decision making.
- Coordination between gaze and locomotion is explored.

## [[Biomarkers and Early Detection]]
- Biomarkers are used for early detection of conditions such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
- Inflammation, neuronal damage, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and neurofilament light proteins are studied as potential biomarkers.
- Movement patterns and the development of CTE are investigated.
- Correlations, study design, and experiment factors are considered in biomarker research.

## [[Peripheral and Central Vertigo]]
- Different types of vertigo, such as peripheral and central vertigo, affect balance and sensory input.
- The neural control of movement, coordination, and motor control are discussed.
- Various conditions, including vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), are explored.
- Jumping, rebound, high jump, physics, biology, neuroscience, and spatial orientation are studied.

## [[Amygdala and Neural Systems]]
- The amygdala and other neural systems play a role in movement, behavior, and emotional responses.
- Fear learning, the limbic system, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray are involved in emotional aspects of human movement.
- Behavioral changes, emotional stimuli, fear extinction, neuropsychology, brain circuits, pain perception, and social behavior are explored.

## [[Cerebellum and Motor Control]]
- The cerebellum is responsible for motor control, voluntary movements, balance, and learning motor skills.
- Different subregions of the cerebellum, such as the anterior lobe, posterior lobe, and flocculonodular lobe, are involved in various functions.
- Body posture, movement coordination, fine motor skills, cognitive functions, and motor learning are studied.

## [[Neuropathways and Learning]]
- Neuropathways, learning, and limb movements are interconnected.
- The corticospinal tract, motor cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord play a role in motor learning and sensorimotor integration.
- Neural system development, synaptic consolidation, long-term potentiation, sleep, and neurodegenerative diseases are discussed.

## [[Fine Motor Control and Hand Movements]]
- Fine motor control of the hand involves the muscular and nervous systems, including the cerebellum and motor cortex.
- Precision, coordination, and the control of small muscle groups are important in tasks such as threading a needle, playing a piano, and handwriting.
- Muscle memory, procedural memory, neural connections, neuroplasticity, and motor learning are explored.

## [[Sleep Deprivation and Brain Function]]
- Sleep deprivation affects brain function, cognitive function, mood swings, and brain health.
- The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, adolescent development, Alzheimer's disease, beta-amyloid, glymphatic system, and toxin removal are discussed.

## [[Neuroplasticity and Age]]
- Neuroplasticity, neural connections, learning, experience, and injury are interconnected.
- Research on older brains, repetition, lifelong learning, active engagement, brain changes with age, cognitive functions, neurogenesis, and Alzheimer's disease is explored.

## [[Movement Disorders and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)]]
- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.
- The vent
